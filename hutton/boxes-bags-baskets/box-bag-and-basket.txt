We have three types of containers: Boxes, Bags and Baskets.

Each of them can store anything, hence we can have:

Box 1, Bog 1, Basket 1
Box "hello", Bag "hi"

Box (Box 1) or Box [(Basket 1),(Basket 2)]


We want to be able do certain operations and transformations on these containers.

1. We want to be able to transform from one to the other. That is we want to that the things stored in one type of container and put them into another.
Box 1 => Bag 1 => Basket 1 

2. We want to be take out things from multiple Boxes, add them or lump them together into a larger Box
Ex: 
 [(Box 1), (Box 2), (Box 3)] => Box 6
 [(Basket "hello"), (Basket " "), (Basket "world")] = Basket "hello world"

3. We want to be able to take (lets say) the contents of Bags and Baskets and put them in Boxes
So we want to:
[(Bag 1),(Bag 2),(Bag 3)] [(Basket True),(Basket False),(Basket True)] 

to [(Box 2),(Box 2),(Box 4)] -- adds one to contents of Bag if the Basket has True, 0 otherwise]
